# EchoFlow: A Foundation Model for Cardiac Ultrasound Image and Video Generation

ðŸ“• Arxiv Preprint: <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.22357>.

EchoFlow is under review. The code will be released as soon as possible.

In the mean time:<br>
ðŸ¤— A complete demo is available here: <https://huggingface.co/spaces/HReynaud/EchoFlow>.<br>
ðŸ¤— All models weights are available here: <https://huggingface.co/HReynaud/EchoFlow/tree/main>.<br>
ðŸ¤— All privacy-preserving synthetic datasets are available here: <https://huggingface.co/datasets/HReynaud/EchoFlow/tree/main>.<br>

Models can be tested with the demo code and it should be trivial to clone the demo and switch the models.<br>
Privacy-preserving synthetic datasets are compatible as-is with this repo: <https://github.com/HReynaud/echonet>.
